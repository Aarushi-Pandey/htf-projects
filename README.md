# React-tionary Business
*Part of ACM Hacktoberfest 2020*

## Overview
[ACM Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.acmutd.co) is a one-day event celebrating open source with workshops
and speakers about modern software practices.

### What You'll Learn
In this workshop, you’ll learn the basics of ReactJS’s most important organizational structure: the component. Knowing how to work with ReactJS components will make it easier for you to transition into developing front end applications using React, Angular, Vue, or some other front end library.

### Technologies
- ReactJS (front end framework)
- Visual Studio Code (recommended text editor)

## Deployment
After your pull request is approved, you'll be able to see the finished product at [website name].

## Instructions
* Clone the repository
* Copy the ACMCard.js and ACMCardStyles.css files in the `src/components` folder. Rename them to something unique
* Change the name of the component to whatever you want
* Change the code in ACMCard.js and ACMCardStyles.css to customize your business card
* Add your component to the App.js file underneath the template card to add your component to the grid
* Create a pull request for your changes to be added to the GH repo

If you need to add an image, such as a logo, place it in the `public/images` folder so that it is accessible to your code.
